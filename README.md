# Reave-Arweave
 A Decentralized Story Sharing Platform based Arweave Blockchain

# What is Reave ?

Reave is a incentive-based platform for sharing stories, information, news and other interesting things and is built from the Arweave block and crypto currencies. Reave provides facilities for content writers to write and share stories while still receiving incentives from their loyal readers. As one of The Incubator participants, Reave integrates an arweave smart contract or can be called SmartWeave with a PST token to run an incentive program. Reave is permanent, all posts will be stored forever on the Arweave blockchain.

# Reave Comparison with Other Platforms

Reave includes writing and information sharing platforms such as blogs, telegra.ph, medium, or steemit. On this platform users can write, insert images, insert videos, links, or program code. Reave comparisons with other platforms namely from the storage model. If other platforms store story data on web hosting and cloud, Reave stores story data on Blockchain. In a sense, as long as the arweave blockchain is mined, user data will always be there and permanent there. Your story cannot be deleted on the blockchain.

# Incentive Scenarios

Similar to Steemit, Reave also has an incentive and profit sharing system. The incentive system is carried out by one user with another user through their writing. The profit sharing system is the result of sending the incentive to the Investor. Let's say Author A writes and publishes stories on Reave. Then Reader B is satisfied with the writings of Author A and sends an incentive in the form of crypto currency that is 1 AR (Arweave) to Author A. Reader B will incur a profit sharing fee (for example: 0.01 AR) and blockchain transaction fees (for example: 0.000000345 AR ). If added together, Reader B needs 1.001000345 AR to send 1 time incentive. Readers get information and benefit from reading, writers benefit from incentives, and investors benefit from the profit sharing costs of each transaction.
