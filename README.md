# Problem

In the first quarter of 2020, internet users around the world reached 4.5 trillion active users. Among these statistics, some of them are users of online publishing media. One problem that is seen today is that the publish platform is still centralized. All writers and readers are subject to and obey the rules and regulations both from the agency and from the government. This allows the deletion of data and author's account so that it can be detrimental to the author. In addition, there is still a lack of platforms that provide income directly from readers to writers.

# Solution

Reave's story and information sharing platform is intended so that the Author has the freedom to write and publish his writings on the internet. Because it is decentralized, it means the user account is 100% owned by the user. All asset, data and information management is managed by the user himself. In other words, Author is free to delete, post and share any information on the Reave platform. Reave is permanent, meaning that all user account data will not be lost in the blockchain ledger. All are recorded and stored on the Arweave Blockchain. In addition, the best solution is to provide 100% incentives to Author.

# What is Reave ?

Reave is a incentive-based platform for sharing stories, information, news and other interesting things and is built from the Arweave block and crypto currencies. Reave provides facilities for content writers to write and share stories while still receiving incentives from their loyal readers. As one of The Incubator participants, Reave integrates an arweave smart contract or can be called SmartWeave with a PST token to run an incentive program. Reave is permanent, all posts will be stored forever on the Arweave blockchain.

# Reave Comparison with Other Platforms

Reave includes writing and information sharing platforms such as blogs, telegra.ph, medium, or steemit. On this platform users can write, insert images, insert videos, links, or program code. Reave comparisons with other platforms namely from the storage model. If other platforms store story data on web hosting and cloud, Reave stores story data on Blockchain. In a sense, as long as the arweave blockchain is mined, user data will always be there and permanent there. Your story cannot be deleted on the blockchain.

# Profit Sharing Token (PST)

The Profit Sharing Token (PST) is Arweave's newest way to make a Decentralized Application in order to provide long-term profits to all user elements. PST uses tokens created by application developers through SmartWeave smart contracts. Reave uses a token with the name Reave Token (REV). This token will not be used by Author and Reader. Rather it will be shared with Investors who want to benefit from the Reave platform. The number of tokens currently available is 1 million REV.

# Incentive Scenarios

Similar to Steemit, Reave also has an incentive and profit sharing system. The incentive system is carried out by one user with another user through their writing. The profit sharing system is the result of sending the incentive to the Investor. Let's say Author A writes and publishes stories on Reave. Then Reader B is satisfied with the writings of Author A and sends an incentive in the form of crypto currency that is 1 AR (Arweave) to Author A. Reader B will incur a profit sharing fee (for example: 0.1 AR) and blockchain transaction fees (for example: 0.000000345 AR ). If added together, Reader B needs 1.100000345 AR to send 1 time incentive. Readers get information and benefit from reading, writers benefit from incentives, and investors benefit from the profit sharing costs of each transaction.

For <strong>writers</strong>, the best incentive scenario is to get lots of incentives from their readers. For example, every article they publish costs 0.1 AR. The author shares their 5 interesting stories, the total cost of 0.5 AR. Suppose each story generates 1 tip from the reader, so the total incentive provided is 5 AR. If reduced by the cost of publishing the story is 5 AR - 0.5 AR = 4.5 AR. In this scenario, the writer benefits a lot.

For <strong>investors</strong>, they will benefit from the costs of each transaction made on the Reave platform. Some of them are when writers publish their stories, when writers and readers write comments, and when readers give incentives to Author. For example, in a month there are 100 writings published, 100 incentives, and 300 comments. So the total profit of investors is 0.1 x (100 + 100 + 300) = 50 AR in a month. If in a year, then 50 x 12 = 600 AR every 1 year.
